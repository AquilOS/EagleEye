Eagle eye is a prototyping software for computer vision algorithms.


This software was created with a few main goals in mind.

1) Create an easy to use GUI that makes development, fast, easy and flexible

2) Save processing algorithm configurations into a portable container to allow for fast assembly of algorithm components.

3) Create a library that can easily be linked into other programs including command line programs

4) Primarily GPU accelerated processing

5) 2d and 3d vision capabilities

6) Rapid prototyping capabilities via runtime modifiable code and an easy to use plugin interface.
